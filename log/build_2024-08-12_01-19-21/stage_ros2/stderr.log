[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstage.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "stage", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "stage" with any of
  the following names:

    stageConfig.cmake
    stage-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "stage" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "stage_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "stage"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
